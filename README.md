# BFS-and-DFS

Programme can build graph with unlimited vertices (in fact, the maximum for proper display is ~30) that are static. Than, you can choose from what vertex to begin and start search in graph.

Algorithm requires symmetric matrix. You can enter 1's by hand in each cell. But insted, you can enter 1 in cell [i,j] and click on this cell. The data inside will be mirrored in cell [j,i].
